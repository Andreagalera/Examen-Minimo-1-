1. Implementation of the Façade (MyBike.java): MyBikeImpl.java
  1.1 The data structures are:
● Array to store the Stations (Object[] )
● LinkedList to store the bikes of a Station
● HashMap to store the Users
● LinkedList to store the bikes of a User
  1.2. The Façade is implemented as a Singleton pattern
 1.3. All the operations have debug logs (LOG4J) at the beginning and end of each operation and error logs when the exceptions are thrown
  1.4. Integration on a JUNIT test

2. Implement a REST Service (using the Jersey libraries) that allows showing the
operations of the façade: addUser, addStation, addBike, bikesByStationOrderByKms,
getBike, bikesByUser. Define the routes and HTP methods for each operation

3. Swagger annotations on the REST service and generate the documentation
